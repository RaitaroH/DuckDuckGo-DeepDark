![alt tag](./Images/banner.png)

Light will blind thee in thy search for answers, dark will make them shine. May the dark be kinder on thine eyes. (DuckDuckGo dark theme)

This is a dark theme for DuckDuckGo inspired by FT DeepDark.

This dark theme is based on the default dark theme for DuckDuckGo found [here](https://userstyles.org/styles/122820/duckduckgo-default-dark-theme).

Also, credit where credit is due for the color palettes down bellow.
